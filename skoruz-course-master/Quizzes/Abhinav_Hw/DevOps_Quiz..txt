4. List the valid host range for subnet 192.168.15.48/28.
Ans: Range : 192.168.15.49 - 192.168.15.62

5. What is DNS and explain it's usefulness.
Ans: The domain name system, more commonly known as "DNS" is the networking system.It allows us to solve human friendly names 
     to unique addresses. A domain name is the human-friendly name that we are used to associating with an internet resource.
     For example,"google.com" is a domain name and the URL "google.com" is associated with the servers owned by Google Inc. The domain name 
     system allows us to reach the Google servers when we type "google.com" into our browsers.


6. Explain the purpose of NS records and CNAME records in DNS?
Ans: A NS record or (name server record) tells recursive nameserverswhich name servers areauthoritative fora zone. 
     Recursive nameservers look at the NS records to work out who to ask next when resolving a name.
     CNAME stands for Canonical Name. CNAME records can be used to alias one name to another.
     For example, if you have a server where you keep all of your documents online, it might normally be accessed through docs.example.com.
     You may also want to access it through documents.example.com. One way to make this possible is to add a CNAME record that points 
     documents.example.com to docs.example.com. When someone visits documents.example.com they will see the exact same content as docs.example.com

7. Describe the purpose of load balancing and list out the load balancing algorithms.
Ans: Load balancing is dividing the amount of work that a computer has to do between two or more computers so that more work gets done in the 
     same amount of time and, in general, all users get served faster. Load balancing can be implemented with hardware, software, or a combination of both. 
     Typically, load balancing is the main reason for computer server clustering.
     list of alogorithms:
     Round Robin,Weighted Round Robin, Random, url, Source IP, Least connections, Least Traffic, Least latency.
    

8. List out the benefits of Proxy Server.
Ans: A proxy server works by intercepting connections between sender and receiver.
     All incoming data enters through one port and is forwarded to the rest of the network via another port. 
     By blocking direct access between two networks, proxy servers make it much more difficult for hackers to get internal addresses 
     and details of a private network.

9. What is NAT and explain it's purpose.
Refer material.
Ans: It was introduced due to lack of IP addresses or looking it from another view. 
     It hides computer,servers and It equipments 
from outside world for security. 
     The Translation of private IP addresses to public is done by NAT.it would save on the IP addresses we use, 
     as every single computer does not need a public address, and also it would hide these private 
computers from the outside world.

10. Explain terms a) TLD b) FQDN c) sub domain in DNS.
Ans: TLD:A top-level domain, or TLD, is the most general part of the domain. The top-level domain is the furthest portion to the right 
     (as separated by a dot). Common top-level domains are "com", "net", "org", "gov", "edu", and "io".
     Top-level domains are at the top of the hierarchy in terms of domain names.
    
     FQDN:A fully qualified domain name, often called FQDN, is what we call an absolute domain name. Domains in the DNS system can be 
     given relative to one another, and as such, can be somewhat ambiguous. A FQDN is an absolute name that specifies its location in 
     relation to the absolute root of the domain name system.
    
     sub domain:A "subdomain" refers to any domain that is part of a larger domain. In this case, "ubuntu.com" can be said to be a 
     subdomain of "com". This is typically just called the domain or the "ubuntu" portion is called a SLD, which means second level domain.
