1. What command would list all files (except . and ..) in the current working directory?
answer:ls

2. What is the simplest command for adding execute permission to file ~/foo, for all users
(without changing any other permissions)?
answer:chmod +x ~/foo

3. Explain what execute permission means/allows when it is associated with a directory.
answer:You can execute (run) the file, if it's a program or script. For folders, this means accessing files in the folder.

4. Suppose that you wanted all users on the machine to be able to see the contents
of the file ~/public/software/instructions.text. Explain the minimum set of
permissions for files and directories needed to allow this, and any security issues that
arise.
answer:chmod 711 ~/public/software/instructions.text.

5. Suppose that you want to allow (only) other users bob and chuck to be able to access
the above file. Explain what you would have to do differently from what you described
above. (You are not allowed to consider the use of ACLs.)
answer:chmod +rwx bob chuck instructions.text


6. How would your answer to the previous problem change if you were to use ACLs (access
control lists)?
answer: setfacl -m u:chuck,bob:rwx ~/public/software/instructions.txt

7. What are set UID (SUID) files, and when are they typically used?

answer:When set-user identification (setuid) permission is set on an executable file, a process that runs this file is granted access based on the owner of the file (usually root), rather than the user who is running the executable file.
 This special permission allows a user to access files and directories that are normally only available to the owner. 
For example, the setuid permission on the passwd command makes it possible for a user to change passwords, 


8. Find one SUID file on a Linux system, and show its long listing (permissions, owner,
etc.).
answer:sudo find / -perm +4000


9. Why are SUID root files considered a security issue?

answer:If you dont want to give credentials of a particular user, but want to run some programs as the owner.and
you dont want to use SUDO command, but want to give execute permission for a file/script etc.

10. What command would be used to set a file foo to be SUID, and how exactly would it
be done?
answer:chmod u+s file1.txt or chmod 4750 file1.txt

11. What command could determine the process ID (PID) of a running SSH server (sshd)?
answer:$ ps aux | grep {process no}

12. What command would best identify which process is using excessive CPU resources?
answer:top 

13. What command that should definitely terminate the process identified above?
answer:kill PID_of_target_process ex :kill -9 pid  ,this can kill all processes you can kill.

14. What file contains the list of valid user ID’s (UID’s) and their associated usernames?
answer:root files


15. What file contains passwords on a Linux system (if that system is using local authen-
tication rather than NIS, etc.)?
answer: Unix systems keep user account information, including one-way encrypted passwords, in a text file called ``/etc/passwd''


16. What is difference between telnet and ssh. When will you use each command. give examples.
answer: 
    SSH :-

* SSH encrypts the data/packets being transferred between the systems so it cannot be Decoded by the Hackers. For ex. the user-name,password etc.
* In Public network mostly SSH is used for remote connection due to it's security mechanism.
* SSH uses authentication which ensures that the source of the data is still the same system and not another. Without the authentication,any other person can intercept and perform some undesired tasks.
* SSH uses public and private keys, to identify hosts and users (authentication).
* By default SSH runs on port 22.

Telnet :-

* The data transferred between the systems is in Plain text (ASCII form) and not in encrypted format which is the major security concern. So the data can be easily read by anybody in the network and can hack the system.
* Telnet is mostly used in Private network as it's highly insecure to use in Public network.
* Telnet does not use Authentication which is again a security issue.
* Telnet runs on port 23.


Hence due to it's security mechanisms, SSH is replacing Telnet
