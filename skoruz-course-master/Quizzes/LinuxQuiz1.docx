1. Suppose that the Current Working Directory is /lib/modules, give a single "CAT" command using a relative pathname
and a command using an absolute pathname, that would print out the contents of the regular file /lib/security/pam-access.
Command with Absolute Path:

Command with Relative Path:

2. What is the standard command to determine the pathname/location  of the mv command/program?

3. What is the purpose of the /sbin subdirectory? (I.e., what is normally stored there?)

4. Explain the difference between “the root directory” and “root’s directory”.

6. What are two commands that could be used to display your current search path?

7. Suppose your current env PATH variable is set to /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin. Explain what
the shell does when you type the command “foo” at a prompt (and type return).

8. Logged in as a non-root user, is /sbin in your search path? Explain why it is or is not

9. Suppose you have created a shell script named foo and have made it executable, but

14. What are the commands that will reset the current working directory to your home directory, regardless of what directory you are currently in?
